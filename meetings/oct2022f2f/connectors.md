## Amazon Glue

* Amazon Glue [6734](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/6734)

need stakeholder or resource

## OPA

* Open Policy Agent [3163](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/3163)

Seems to have traction for enforcement - VDC scenario instead of Ranger

## Apache Atlas

* Customer need expressed, one of the higher priority items
* May wish/need to redesign
* Atlas [Repo](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem)
* Last week updated for reasonable currency - dependencies, now builds with 3.12. Untested.
* Stable test environment needed (container)
